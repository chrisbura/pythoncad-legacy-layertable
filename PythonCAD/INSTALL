Installation
============

The installation of PythonCAD is a two-step process. First,
execute the setup.py script

$ python setup.py install

This command will install the files in the "Generic" and
"Interface" directories into the Python library directory.
You may need to be root to do this on your machine.

Next, copy the file "gtkpycad.py" into one of the directories
in your PATH. Commonly this will be "/usr/local/bin", or
"/usr/bin".

At this point you should be able to invoke the gtkpycad.py
file at a prompt:

$ gtkpycad.py

After a few seconds, the application should start.

Work has begun on making PythonCAD offer native language
support. Translation files are in the 'po/' subdirectory.
The '.po' file needs to be converted to a '.mo' file, a
job for the 'msgfmt' program. Once the '.mo' file has
been generated, it should be copied into the appropriate
'locale' directory for your system and the user environment
adjusted to access the correct locale. For the time being
the installation of these files requires much manual work;
as more translations appear it is hoped the installation
of the '.mo' files will become more automated.

Problems
========

If something doesn't work, there are a couple of things to
check. For the sake of a few examples, pretend that the
python installation is in "/usr" and Python-2.2.X is installed,
so the site-packages directory is "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages",
and the python binary is "/usr/bin/python". Also pretend that
the "gtkpycad.py" file is copied into "/usr/bin".

Does "/usr/bin/gtkpycad.py" have the execute bits set? If
not, do a "chmod a+x /usr/bin/gtkpycad.py" to set these bits.
